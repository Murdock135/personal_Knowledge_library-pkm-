TLDR:
1. Create a graph of the new project structure
2. Create a todo list
3. Create a new branch `refactor`
4. For each component to be restructured, create a new subbranch e.g. `refactor/component_a` and when done restructured, commit to the `refactor` branch.
5. Before merging, test if the refactored component works.
