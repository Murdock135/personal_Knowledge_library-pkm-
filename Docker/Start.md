This is my folder for docker-related things. The material in this folder attempts to replace reading the [Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and [Manuals](https://docs.docker.com/manuals/) as I do not think those do a good job at tying together all the knowledge within. But these notes are of course not a replacement for the [Docker reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/).
# Prerequisites 
1. [The linux file system ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbmWOjuFmgA&t=81s)
2. [Binaries](https://www.interserver.net/tips/kb/linux-binary-directories-explained/)
# How to read these notes (roadmap and sequencing)
If you are just starting out with docker, go through the installation steps written in the official docs. After which, start at [[Docker/main|main]] where I take an applied approach to get you familiarized with docker commands (looking at the syntax of the commands and getting to know what to expect as their outputs).
