**Definition**- It's just a discrete scale.
- When responding to a Likert item, respondents specify their level of agreement or disagreement on a symmetric agree-disagree scale for a series of statements. Thus, the range captures the intensity of their feelings for a given item
- A scale can be created as the simple sum or average of questionnaire responses over the set of individual items (questions). In so doing, Likert scaling assumes distances between each choice (answer option) are equal. Many researchers employ a set of such items that are highly correlated (that show high [internal consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency "Internal consistency")) but also that together will capture the full domain under study (which requires less-than perfect correlations). Others hold to a standard by which "All items are assumed to be replications of each other or in other words items are considered to be parallel instruments".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale#cite_note-vanAlphen1994-8): 197  By contrast, [modern test theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory "Item response theory") treats the difficulty of each item (the [ICCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory#The_item_response_function "Item response theory")) as information to be incorporated in scaling items.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale#cite_note-9)
