Let X be a set. Thus P(X) is its power set. Then, a subset, $\Sigma \subset P(X)$ is called a $\sigma$-algebra if and only if it satisfies the following three properties
1. X is in $\Sigma$.
2. $\Sigma$ is *closed under complementation* (if $A \in \Sigma$, then $A' \in \Sigma$)
3. $\Sigma$ is closed under countable unions.
From these properties, it follows that a $\sigma$-algebra is closed under countable intersections (by applying De-Morgan's laws).
