When the nvim lsp client starts, it enables diagnostics  [vim.diagnostic](https://neovim.io/doc/user/diagnostic.html#vim.diagnostic) (see [vim.diagnostic.config()](https://neovim.io/doc/user/diagnostic.html#vim.diagnostic.config\(\)) to customize). It also sets various default options, listed below, if (1) the language server supports the functionality and (2) the options are empty or were set by the builtin runtime (ftplugin) files. The options are not restored when the LSP client is stopped or detached.
