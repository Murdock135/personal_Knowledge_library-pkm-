- **Essence of OS**: Resource management among users such that every processor is active. 
- Apple introduced the paradigm of *user-experience* besides merely resource management. Thus, OS development also accounts for this in modern times.
- Modern OSs are *interrupt-driven*. 
- There's a note that says that *wait instruction* idles the CPU until the next interrupt. JimR says that this isn't really true.
