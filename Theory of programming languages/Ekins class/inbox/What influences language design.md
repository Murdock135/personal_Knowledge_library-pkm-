Two things at the forefront of what influences are 
- Comp architecture e.g. Von Neumann, Harvard.
- Programming methodologies

- Imperative languages (c++, java, etc) are intended for the VN (Von Neumann) architecture. These languages preserve state. But there are situations where we do not want to preserve state. 
- Programming methodologies are influenced by extraneous factors for example, machine compute, people efficiency, chosen paradigms (fp, oop, REST, data abstractions, etc). Paradigms are also part of 'methodologies'. One such paradigm is FP (Functional Programming). In FP, there are no loops, unlike OO languages.
