>There are two meanings. Both related to some form of **explanatory reasoning.** If you wanted the historical sense, refer to [[Abduction (historical sense)]]

In modern philosophical literature, it refers to the place of (See [[Phrase- "The place of ..."]]) *explanatory reasoning* in *justifying hypotheses*. In this sense, Abduction is also called "Inference to the Best Explanation"

>This entry contrasts abduction with other types of inference; points at prominent uses of it, both in and outside philosophy; considers various more or less precise statements of it; discusses its normative status; and highlights possible connections between abduction and Bayesian confirmation theory.

# Abduction: The general idea
*Note: For a short TLDR, read [[#TLDR]].

You happen to know that Tim and Harry have recently had a terrible row that ended their friendship. Now someone tells you that she just saw Tim and Harry jogging together. The best explanation for this that you can think of is that they made up. You conclude that they are friends again.
One morning you enter the kitchen to find a plate and cup on the table, with breadcrumbs and a pat of butter on it, and surrounded by a jar of jam, a pack of sugar, and an empty carton of milk. You conclude that one of your house-mates got up at night to make him- or herself a midnight snack and was too tired to clear the table. This, you think, best explains the scene you are facing. To be sure, it might be that someone burgled the house and took the time to have a bite while on the job, or a house-mate might have arranged the things on the table without having a midnight snack but just to make you believe that someone had a midnight snack. But these hypotheses strike you as providing much more contrived explanations of the data than the one you infer to.
Walking along the beach, you see what looks like a picture of Winston Churchill in the sand. It could be that, as in the opening pages of Hilary Putnam’s book _Reason, Truth, and History_, (1981), what you see is actually the trace of an ant crawling on the beach. The much simpler, and therefore (you think) much better, explanation is that someone intentionally drew a picture of Churchill in the sand. That, in any case, is what you come away believing.
In these examples, the conclusions do not follow logically from the premises. For instance, it does not follow logically that Tim and Harry are friends again from the premises that they had a terrible row which ended their friendship and that they have just been seen jogging together; it does not even follow, we may suppose, from all the information you have about Tim and Harry. Nor do you have any useful statistical data about friendships, terrible rows, and joggers that might warrant an inference from the information that you have about Tim and Harry to the conclusion that they are friends again, or even to the conclusion that, probably (or with a certain probability), they are friends again. What leads you to the conclusion, and what according to a considerable number of philosophers may also warrant this conclusion, is precisely the fact that Tim and Harry’s being friends again would, if true, _best_ _explain_ the fact that they have just been seen jogging together. (The proviso that a hypothesis be true if it is to explain anything is taken as read from here on.) Similar remarks apply to the other two examples. The type of inference exhibited here is called _abduction_ or, somewhat more commonly nowadays, _Inference to the Best_ _Explanation_.
## TLDR:
**Example 1: Jogging Friends**  
You know Tim and Harry had a serious falling out. Now someone says they saw the two jogging together. You infer: they must have reconciled. Why? Because being friends again best explains their jogging together.

**Example 2: Midnight Snack**  
You walk into the kitchen and see a dirty plate, breadcrumbs, butter, and an empty milk carton. The simplest explanation? A housemate had a late-night snack and didn’t clean up. Alternatives (e.g., a prank or a burglar) are possible but less plausible.

**Example 3: Churchill in the Sand**  
You see an image of Churchill in the sand. Maybe an ant wandered randomly. But the better explanation? Someone deliberately drew it.

**Concept Summary:**  
These conclusions aren’t deductively certain nor backed by statistics. What justifies them is that they **best explain** the observations. This mode of reasoning is known as **Inference to the Best Explanation** (IBE) or **abduction**.
