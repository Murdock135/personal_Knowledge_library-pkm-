The Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) function is a primitive in Evidence theory. It *corresponds to* the **amount of evidence** that *an element of X* belongs to the set A but to no particular subset of A and is defined as,
$$
\begin{matrix}
m:\mathcal{P}(X) \rightarrow[0,1] \\
m(\phi)=0
\end{matrix}
$$
where $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is the power set of X and A is a subset of the power set of X.
$$
\begin{matrix}
A \subset \mathcal{P}(X)
\end{matrix}
$$
Here
- Domain: Power set of A
- Codomain: [0,1]
Additionally, the sum of all elements $A$ is 1
$$
\sum_{A \in \mathcal{P}(X)} m(A)=1
$$
