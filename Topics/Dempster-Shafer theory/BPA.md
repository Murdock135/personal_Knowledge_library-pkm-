The Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) function is a primitive in Evidence theory. It *corresponds to* the **amount of evidence** that *an element of X* belongs to the set A but to no particular subset of A and is defined as,
$$
\begin{matrix}
m:\mathcal{P}(X) \rightarrow[0,1] \\
m(\phi)=0
\end{matrix}
$$
where $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is the power set of X and A is a subset of the power set of X.
