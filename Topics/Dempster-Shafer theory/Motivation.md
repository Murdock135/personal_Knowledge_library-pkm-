Dempster shafer theory was created to overcome the following shortcoming within probability theory:
In probability theory, events are considered to comprise a [[Sigma algebra and field]]. Which means that as we assign a probability to an event (probability that the event occurs), we automatically assign a probability to the complement of the event (probability that the event does not occur).
Furthermore, in probability theory, if sufficient evidence isn't found that a certain process follows a certain distribution, the uniform distribution is adopted, making the probability of all events equal. DST allows us to sidestep this.
Finally, DST allows thinking about probabilities of sets of events even if the probabilities of the individual elements are unknown. 
The theory allows one to combine evidence from different sources and arrive at a degree of belief (represented by a mathematical object calledÂ _belief function_) that takes into account all the available evidence.
