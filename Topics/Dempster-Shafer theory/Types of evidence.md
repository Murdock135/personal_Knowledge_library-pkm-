1. Consonant evidence: Nested structure of subsets. Elements in smaller subsets are subsumed by larger sets.
2. Consistent evidence: At lease one element common to all subsets.
3. Arbitrary evidence: No *universally common* element
4. Disjoint evidence: No two subsets have elements in common. Totally disjoin.
