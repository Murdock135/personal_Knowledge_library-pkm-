> The complexity of a system's behavior often comes from the complexity of its environment, rather than the complexity of the program or the system itself.

This was originally an idea from the **Simon's ant metaphor**. In simpler terms, it means that if a program with simple rules interacts with a complex problem, its behavior can appear very sophisticated, but the complexity actually lies in the problem, not the program

Relating to **knowledge engineering** (36:41).

This idea outlines **three heuristics** for eliciting knowledge from experts when building systems:

1. **Deal with specific cases:** Instead of asking general questions, observe experts handling specific situations to uncover detailed knowledge (36:51).
2. **Ask about differences:** Inquire why similar-looking things are handled differently to discover new vocabulary and rules (38:07).
3. **Build a system and see where it cracks:** Implement a system and test it to identify missing rules or knowledge gaps when it makes a mistake or fails (40:01).

The speaker also notes that these heuristics are useful for **learning a new subject yourself**, by treating yourself as an "expert system" that needs to acquire knowledge (41:41).
