**Definition**- The likert scale is a *discrete* scale that indicates the level of agreement or disagreement with a certain topic.
The scale is usually symmetric and assumes equal distance between each point in the scale. Many researchers employ a set of such items that are highly correlated (that show high [[#Internal consistency]]) such that they will together capture the full domain under study (which requires less-than perfect correlations). Others hold to a standard by which "all items are assumed to be replicas of each other or in other words items are considered parallel instruments" [vanAlphen1994-8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2648.1994.20010196.x). By contrast, [modern test theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory) treats the difficulty of each item as information to be incorporated in scaling items.

# Internal consistency
Usually measured with Chronbach's alpha, internal consistency is a *statistic* that is derived from the pairwise correlations between items. The value ranges from $(-\infty, 1)$.
- Alpha will be negative whenever **within-subject variability > between subject variability**.
A commonly accepted rule of thumb for describing internal consistency is as follows [SPSS for Windows, 4e](https://archive.org/details/spssforwindowsst00geor)

- Very high *reliabilities (0.95)* or higher are not necessarily desirable, as this indicates that the items may be redundant.
- Unlike [Item Response Theory (IRT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory "Item response theory") based perspectives on reliability, Cronbach's alpha only provides a single summary value which may not accurately represent the variability of reliability across different points of the score distribution (e.g., it may overstate the reliability of measurement at extremes of the score distribution)([McNeish and Dumas, 2025](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-025-02611-8))
- An alternative way of thinking about internal consistency is that it is the extent to which all of the items of a test measure the same [latent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable "Latent variable"). The advantage of this perspective over the notion of a high average correlation among the items of a test – the perspective underlying Cronbach's alpha – is that the average item correlation is affected by [skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness "Skewness") (in the distribution of item correlations) just as any other [average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average "Average") is. Thus, whereas the [modal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_\(statistics\) "Mode (statistics)") item correlation is zero when the items of a test measure several unrelated latent variables, the average item correlation in such cases will be greater than zero. Thus, whereas the ideal of measurement is for all items of a test to measure the same latent variable, alpha has been demonstrated many times to attain quite high values even when the set of items measures several unrelated latent variables.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-12) The hierarchical "coefficient omega" may be a more appropriate index of the extent to which all of the items in a test measure the same latent variable.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-14) Several different measures of internal consistency are reviewed by Revelle & Zinbarg (2009).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency#cite_note-16)
