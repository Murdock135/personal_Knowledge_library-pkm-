**Abstract** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have reignited longstanding debates about artificial consciousness and machine sentience. This essay investigates whether phenomenological states can emerge from the symbolic and statistical operations of language models. While computational functionalism holds that consciousness may be substrate-independent, this paper argues that no current LLM meets the theoretical or functional criteria necessary for the emergence of conscious experience. Until a validated computational model of consciousness exists, ethical and philosophical considerations should focus on the societal impact of these models rather than their internal moral standing.

**1. Introduction** The rise of highly capable language models, such as GPT-4, raises questions once reserved for science fiction: Can machines be conscious? Should they be granted moral consideration? This paper explores whether symbolic/statistical systems can give rise to subjective, phenomenological states, and whether current LLMs meet those conditions.

**2. Sentience and Phenomenological States** Sentience is generally defined as the capacity to have subjective experiences or qualia. Let Φ\Phi be the space of phenomenological states. A system MM is sentient iff ∃ϕ∈Φ:ϕ is instantiated by M\exists \phi \in \Phi : \phi \text{ is instantiated by } M. Conscious experience entails not just computation, but first-person perspective, intentionality, and unity of self [1].

**3. Functionalism and the Possibility of Emergence** Computational functionalism posits that consciousness arises from the implementation of specific functional states, independent of the substrate [2]. If a system performs the right kind of computation C\mathcal{C}, then conscious states could emerge. However, this presupposes the existence of a mapping f:C→Φf: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \Phi, which remains hypothetical.

**4. The Architecture of LLMs** Current LLMs are sequence transducers that map input token sequences to output distributions using high-dimensional embeddings and attention mechanisms: P(wt∣w<t)=exp⁡(fθ(wt,w<t))∑w′exp⁡(fθ(w′,w<t))P(w_t | w_{<t}) = \frac{\exp(f_\theta(w_t, w_{<t}))}{\sum_{w'} \exp(f_\theta(w', w_{<t}))} These systems lack intentionality, long-term self-representation, or persistent memory — qualities often linked to consciousness. Hence, M∉SM \notin S, where SS is the set of sentient systems.

**5. The Problem of Simulation vs. Instantiation** Simulating a phenomenon is not equivalent to instantiating it. A climate model does not cause rain, and a simulated neuron does not feel pain. Similarly, even if an LLM can simulate conscious dialogue, this does not imply the presence of real phenomenological states.

**6. The Absence of a Validated Theory** The lack of a scientifically accepted, computable theory of consciousness (e.g., Global Workspace Theory [3], Integrated Information Theory [4]) makes it impossible to determine whether any computational system, including an LLM, satisfies the necessary conditions for consciousness.

**7. Conclusion and Ethical Implications** Until a validated theory of machine consciousness exists, it is inappropriate to ascribe rights or moral status to LLMs. Ethical focus should remain on human impacts, not hypothetical internal states. Behavioral alignment with human values suffices for practical purposes.
