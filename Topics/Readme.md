These are my notes on various topics.

How to open these notes: These notes are meant to be kept in my [Obsidian vault.](https://obsidian.md/). So, images won't render if you load the notes here in Github. They will render if you download the notes or fork the repo and open the folder you downloaded the repo into using obsidian.

How to use the notes: These notes aren't meant to be a one-stop for learning any topic. I am treating this as a "handbook" for quick reference and to register the topics into memory by taking notes.
