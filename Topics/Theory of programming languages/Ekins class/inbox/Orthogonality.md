Orthogonality is an attribute, attributed to features that come with a language. The attribute reduces the amount of conceptual overlap between features. for example, in java
`array.length` and `arraylist.size()` attempt to accomplish the same function, but the names of the functions are different, therefore having low *orthogonality.*
## Key aspects
- Minimal interference
- Consistency
- Simplified design
